        "# Answers:\n",
        "1. Accuracy may not adequately reflect the effectiveness of this model. Looking at the data I began with for my `y_df`, it is easily visible that the data from both of the columns is rather imbalanced and probably skewed. This can cause bias or mispleading/high scores during the training process, possibly leaning towards one outcome over another. I believe that I need to incorporate other metrics to use on this data, such a precision, recall, F1-score, and possibly a confusion matrix.\n",
        "2. For the **department** output layer, `department_output`, I chose **Softmax**. This is because this column is a multi-class categorical variable. From my understanding, this is best so that exactly one class is the correct classification for each *instance*, through the probability distribution over the classes. It will ensure that the sum of potential outcomes will be 1. A similar thought process was applied when thinking about the encoding menthod that the starter code required for this column (**OneHotEncoder**). A simpler explanation would be that each value in the department column cannot be true at the same time (For example, you cannot work in both the sales AND human resources departments at the same time. They are exclusive of each other).\n",
        "\n",
        "  For the **attrition** output layer, `attrition_output`, I chose **Sigmoid**. This is because of the binary categorical variable (Yes or No : 1 or 0). There are only two possibilites here; if it is not 'Yes', it will be 'No', and vice versa. My first choice for use was Softmax, however even after changing it to my final choice of sigmoid, the results did not change.\n",
        "3.\n",
        "*  First, when creating `shared_layer1` and `shared_layer_2`, I used 'relu' for activation. I could use a different activation function for these, such as leaky relu.\n",
        "* Second point about my layer creation; I used 64 neurons for the first shared layer, and only 32 for the second shared layer. This could be changed when tuning the model as well, such as increasing the neurons and adding additional hidden layers (adjusting neurons from there).\n",
        "* Third, I could adjust the number of epochs used to train the model, increasing them to allow further analysis.\n",
        "* The last and main improvement that I will point out is the encoding method used for the 'Attrition' column. While 'OneHotEncoder' was specifically what I am told to use, wouldn't a 'LabelEncoder' be better to use in this instance? With such a binary choice as \"Yes\" or \"No,\" this would dispell any unnecessary complexity, and result in just those two output probabilities. This would further change the compile method I used, where it would require *`binary_crossentropy`*. I could also use an OrdinalEncoder with categories set to yes or no.\n",
